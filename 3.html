<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript is an object-based script programming language. This language is mainly used within a web browser and has the ability to access embedded objects from other applications. It is also used in server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha, and later LiveScript, which eventually became JavaScript. Although JavaScript has similar syntax to Java in Sun Microsystems, this is because both languages are based on the basic syntax of C language, and Java and JavaScript are not directly related. Except for names and phrases, there are more similarities to self or scheme than Java. JavaScript is recognized as the language that best implements the standard specifications of ECMAScript, and up to ECMAScript 5 (ES5) is supported by most browsers, but from ECMAScript 6 onwards, it is compiled as a translator for browser compatibility.[4]
