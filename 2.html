<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
  The Cascading Style Sheet is a style language that describes how the markup language is actually displayed [1], which is mainly used in HTML and XHTML, and is also available in XML. It is the standard of W3C and has a high degree of freedom when defining layout and style.

The default file name [2] is style.css.

If markup language (ex: HTML) is responsible for the body of a website, CSS can be said to be responsible for decorating like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can decorate it like a completely different website just by changing the CSS file while leaving the HTML structure intact.

In the case of CSS3, which is currently being developed, features such as shadow effects, gradations, and variations have been added to replace images produced by graphic editing programs. In addition, various animation features have been added, replacing Adobe Flash to some extent.
