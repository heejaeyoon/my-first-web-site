<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web (WW3) is a global information space where people can share information through computers connected to the Internet. It is often simply called the Web. The term is often synonymous with the Internet, but strictly speaking, it is a different concept. The Web is just one service that operates on the Internet, such as e-mail. However, since 1993, the Web has taken an absolute place in the Internet structure.

It also refers to a transmission method in which pictures and characters are exchanged using HTTP protocols, hypertext, and HTML formats on the Internet.
